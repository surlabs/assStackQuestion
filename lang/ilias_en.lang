This setting should be turned on unless you are doing development that involves changing the Maxima code. The current state of the cache is shown on the healthcheck page.

ui_admin_configuration_connection_preparse_all_title#:#Preparse all
ui_admin_configuration_connection_preparse_all_description#:#We recommend all code in question variables, etc., even from trusted teachers, is pre-parsed for potentially malicious patterns.  This is especially important when accepting imported questions from known sources.  However, it is possible for this pre-parse to time-out and it would be necessary to disable this check (temporarily) to back out of a potential dead end.  This code is still under testing and development and this setting will be removed in future releases ensuring this pre-parse is always applied.

ui_admin_configuration_connection_cache_parsed_expressions_longer_than_description#:#The expression parser gets quite slow on long expressions (for example complicated question variables). Therefore we cache the result of parsing expressions longer than a this limit. Ideally, this setting should be set to a value where doing the cache lookup takes about as long as doing the parsing. 50 characters is an educated guess at this. If set to 0, the cache is disabled.
ui_admin_configuration_connection_cache_parsed_expressions_longer_than_validation#:#The value must be a number.
