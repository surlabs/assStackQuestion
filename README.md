# STACK Question plugin for ILIAS

Welcome to the official repository for [STACK for ILIAS](https://stackforilias.com).

## What is STACK?

STACK is the world-leading open-source online assessment system for mathematics and STEM and the most powerful STEM learning tool available in ILIAS

> **Note** STACK for ILIAS is from 01.06.2023 officially maintained on the **SURLABS** repository. Original ILIFAU repository has been archived, please change your git remote to the new one in order to keep using the plugin.

## Installation & Update

### Software Requirements
STACK requires [PHP](https://php.net) version 7.4 or 8.0 to work properly on your ILIAS 8 platform

STACK requires the [mbstring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) PHP library to run properly, this library is by default included in ILIAS, but please ensure your installation includes that library on the composer.json dependencies.

STACK requires [Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/), an Open-Source Computer Algebra System to work. Ensure you have Maxima instance installed on the web server running your ILIAS installation, or you have a Maxima Pool / Goemaxima connection before installing this plugin in your platform.
* If you are using a local Maxima Installation, ensure it is at least Maxima **5.44**
* If you are using MaximaPool or GoeMaxima, the expected compiled version is **2023121100**
> If you are using Goemaxima, ensure you include in the plugin configuration on the Maxima Libraries configuration the four included Maxima libraries: **stats, distrib, descriptive, simplex**

STACK requires [GNUPlot](https://www.gnuplot.info), which is used by Maxima to generate graphical plots of functions etc. It is freely available
and part of most Linux distrubutions. GNUplot needs to be installed on the web server
running your ILIAS and maxima installations.

STACK requires [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org), to be active on your ILIAS installation.

MathJax is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics. It is used by the STACK plugin
to display maths in question, user input validation and feedback. It can either be linked from
cdn.mathjax.org or downloaded to your own web server. It has to be configured in ILIAS:

1. Administration > Third Party Software > MathJax
2. Enable MathJax and enter the URL to MathJax (Currently only MathJax rendered in browser option is supported)
3. Save

### Installation steps
1. Create subdirectories, if necessary for Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/
2. In Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/ **ensure you delete any previous assStackQuestion folder**
3. Then, execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surlabs/STACK.git ./assStackQuestion
cd assStackQuestion
git checkout ilias8_stack
```
3. STACK uses the ILIAS composer autoloader functionality so, after installing or update the plugin, ensure you run on the ILIAS root folder
```bash
composer du
php setup/setup.php update
```
***
**Please ensure you don't ignore plugins on composer.json**
***
